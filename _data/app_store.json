Or how much that 64oz growler actually costs without having to do conversions in your head?\n\nWith Six-Pack Equivalent Calculator, you put in the cost of your beer and the amount you got and the app will tell you the cost if you bought a six-pack of that particular beer.\n\nThe idea is that everyone knows how much a six-pack of their favorite beer costs. This converter will help you determine the price of what you’re drinking right now to an equivalent you are already familiar with!\n\nI was happy to realize that a $9 fill of my 1/2 gallon growler (64oz) at my local brewpub was the equivalent of a $10.12 six-pack! That’s a great deal for craft beer when I’m used to paying upwards of $12 or more for good craft beer.\n\nThis app is open source.
